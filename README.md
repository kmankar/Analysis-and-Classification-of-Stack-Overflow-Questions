# Analysis-and-Classification-of-Stack-Overflow-Questions

## For Python Version 3

## Dataset
The data set was obtained from BigQuery (Stack Overflow database). The Stack Overflow database contains multiple tables 
like badges, comments etc. Our primary data set  includes columns - title, body, tags and view_count from the post_questions table. 
The table originally contains 18154493 records, but for this project we have chosen 7500 records due to memory and processing constraints.
